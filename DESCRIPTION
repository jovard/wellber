Description: The package allows for country well-being comparison using the 2017 OECD Better 
    Life Index data. The dataset covers 38 OECD countries, across 24 well-being indicators 
    that have been categorised into 10 indicator classes. 
    A shiny app is included for interactive country, indicator and sample selection, for small, 
    medium and large plot ranges. A bar chart plot is produced for any given selection to display
    the country of interest and those countries sharing a similar indicator performance. Included
    in the plots are the relative rankings for the indicator choosen. Furthermore there is the
    option to plot the indicator class performance for a more focused comparative analysis.
